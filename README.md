Crop Yield Prediction: An Investigation on Machine Learning Algorithms
This project investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in predicting crop yield, a crucial factor in agricultural planning and food security. The work was published as a research paper at the IEEE International Conference on System, Computation, Automation and Networking (ICSCAN) 2023.

Project Overview
The agriculture sector, a cornerstone of the Indian economy, faces the challenge of increasing production to meet rising population demands. Accurate crop yield prediction is a critical tool for farmers and policymakers, enabling data-driven decisions on resource allocation, market strategy, and food distribution.

This project addresses the challenges of yield prediction by:

Market & Research Analysis: We began with an extensive review of over 50 academic papers to understand the existing landscape of machine learning in agriculture. This foundational research helped in identifying a clear problem space and a data-driven approach.

Data Strategy: We sourced and aggregated real-time, unstructured data from government portals, including meteorological, soil, and crop-specific parameters, to build a robust and comprehensive dataset.

Model Benchmarking: We developed and rigorously compared the performance of several machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, to identify the most accurate predictive model.

Results: The final model achieved a high accuracy of 93.95%, providing a reliable framework for future crop yield forecasting.

This project demonstrates a strong ability to conduct in-depth research, manage and prepare complex datasets, and apply a rigorous, data-driven methodology to solve a real-world problem. It showcases a blend of technical skills with a strategic, analytical mindset, which is key for a product-focused role.
